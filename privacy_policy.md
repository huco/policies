Peak Watts - Privacy Policy  
----------------

Last updated: March 11, 2023.

### Introduction  
This privacy policy applies to the **Peak Watts** app and explains how we collect, use, and share information about you when you use our app.

If you choose to use our Service you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy. The Personal Information that we collect is used for providing and improving the Service.

### 1. Information Collection and Use  

### a) User Profile
For a better experience while using our Service, we may require you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information, including but not limited to:
* Gender
* Birth year
* Weight

The information that we request will be stored on your device exclusively and be used to provide you with more accurate metrics.  

### b) In-ride Data Collection
In order to provide the Service app needs access to your current location as well as other cycling-related data which can be obtained from the device or external sensors.

The following list describes which data we might access and record:

* **Location data**
  - GPS data is accessed during the ride to keep track of your location (longitude, latitude), altitude and speed. The first time you start a ride we will request your permission to access your location at any time. This permission is required to record ride location when app is in the background (for example when you use another app or lock screen).
  - App will access your location from the background only during an active ride.
  - You can choose to revoke location access by disabling "Location Access" in the activity profile (indoor profile is an example of such configuration).
  - Apart from access during the ride, app might access your location while you are navigating the app interface to provide services like weather forecast for your location. 

* **External sensors**
  - Data collected from connected Bluetooth sensors might include your speed, cadence, heart rate, or power data. This data is displayed to you during the ride and recorded for post-ride analysis.
  - App will connect to sensor only if you choose to pair that sensor. 
  - You can disconnect or unpair sensors at any time from the "Sensors" view.

* **Device sensors**
  - App might use device barometer data, if your device is equipped with it, for elevation calculation. App will monitor your device's battery state during the ride to provide battery level and battery life estimation. The default app configuration allows the use of both sensors. 
  - You can revoke access to these sensors by unpairing them from the "Sensors" view at any time.

Data collection and recording will happen even if the app is in the background. Recorded data is stored exclusively on your device. 

The only way that data can leave your device is if you choose to export it.

### c) Indirectly Collected Data
We use Firebase Analytics, Firebase Crashlytics, and Firebase Performance Monitoring to collect app usage, crash reports, and performance-related data.
We use this data to understand and analyze app usage trends and to operate, maintain and develop our Services. 

If you wish so you can revoke access to analytics and performance monitoring services from app settings view. 

We require crash reporting service to be enabled in order to operate and develop the Service.

### d) Advertisements
We do not serve advertisements within the app.

### 2. Information Sharing with Third Parties
